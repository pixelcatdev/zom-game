Crafting

- crafting requires resources, takes time but importantly needs a party intelligence level
- each survivor comes with an intelligence stat (or has an intelligence trait, tbd)
- if the cumulative intelligence score is met and the resources are available, the item can be crafted if the recipe is known
- recipes can be bought from traders, given as quest rewards or discovered by experimentation (my favourite approach)
