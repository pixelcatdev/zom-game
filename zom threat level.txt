-how is the threatlevel based

- base threat level = 0

- threat level

- increases at night
- increases as time progresses
- increases in certain biomes

- mountain - 0
- coastal - 1
- countryside - 2
- woodland - 3
- urban - 4

-----

biome + time of day + world threat level + party

- world threat = every month threat level + 1

- time of day - night = 2

- party - (party size / 2) + any trait based (conspicuous, clumsy, loud etc)

----------------------------------

Urban, at night, 1 month in =  4 + 1 + 2 = Threat level of 7

Calculating ambush chance:

- ThreatChance = Random (1,20) + BiomeThreatLevel + WorldThreatLevel + TimeOfDayThreatLevel + PartyThreatLevel = 10-30
- RNG vs ThreatChance
